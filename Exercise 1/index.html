    <h1>JavaScript Debugging Exercise</h1>
    <p>Your task is to fix the function <code>troubleshooting</code> so that it logs the number 2 to the console.</p>
    <p>Currently, the function is returning an incorrect result. Carefully analyze the code and make the necessary changes without hardcoding the value.</p>
    <p>Once you think you've fixed the issue, open the browser's Developer Console (Right-click and select "Inspect" then go to the "Console" tab) to see if the number 2 is logged as the result.</p>
    <p><strong>Hint:</strong> The problem is in how the variables are being combined in the <code>result</code> line.</p>
